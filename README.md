## Work Synopsis
In my individual task, I used jazz with a similar but different style to Boogie Woogie as the basis for creating animation effects using audio. I plan to stay in touch with the musical spirit of Boogie Woogie, giving the audience a sense of response to the original work while providing them with a new experience.

The music I have chosen is the music *Trinidad, Hello* by Dizzy Gillespie, the central character of Bebop jazz. The complex chord structure and rapid melody of Bebop reflect the continuous evolution of New York, and the irregularity and improvisation of this music style can also reflect the uncertainty and rich diversity of modern urban life.

**The following are three versions of my dynamic designs for rectangles that change with music:**
- **Version 1**: Colour Change (transparency)
- **Version 2**: Shake Effect
- **Version 3**: Move Effect

In this audio visualization work, the yellow lines remain unchanged, just like a static street. The unmovable large rectangle presents the time cycle of architecture from dawn to dusk through colour changes. The small coloured rectangles moving on the yellow lines symbolize the people rushing up the streets of New York, each carrying their own stories and personalities.

This work brings the audience's senses from a single visual experience to a multi-sensory world that combines audio and visual elements. It is a reinterpretation and rhythmic imagination of Piet Mondrian 'Broadway Boogie Woogie'.
